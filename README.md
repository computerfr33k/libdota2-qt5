[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/computerfr33k/libdota2-qt5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/computerfr33k/libdota2-qt5)

This is a Qt 5 library for interacting with the Dota 2 API. It allows you to retrieve info such as match info, match history, and more.

This library is NOT stable or even in an alpha state. Please do NOT depend on it as the API is extremely likely to change as I work on it further.

I am still figuring out how I want to structure this the most efficiently and as clean of code to do it as possible.
